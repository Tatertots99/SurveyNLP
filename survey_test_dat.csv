"Global climate models predict decreased ocean productivity, but the regional variability of changes in productivity is not well-known and many models disagree on the sign of changes. There is a need for improved scientific understanding of the impact of ocean warming on primary production. This includes more observations of biogeochemical variables and improved models.","As ocean circulation and water masses change due to climate change, ocean users (particularly fisheries) are becoming more reliant on oceanographic measurements to supplement traditional knowledge. However, oceanographic instruments are expensive which makes them inaccessible. There is a need for low-cost and open source oceanographic sensor development.","With increased industrial production, sustenance and artisanal fishing are often threatened.

"Coastal systems are heavily tied to upland systems. There is a regulatory gap where land meets the sea, where agencies are only responsible for one or the other (upland or ocean). While I am in the US I’d imagine this happens many places. Because of this separation, agencies trying to protect reefs (e.g. Florida keys) have limited ability to improve water quality that is significantly impacted by larger issues at hand. Around the world we need to stop the separation of land and coastal waters and understand how our use greatly impacts coastal waters and the greater oceans. Seagate spills, erosion issues due to upland Development, leaking septic tanks, fresh water diversion, etc. are all things that impact our coastal systems, but the agencies responsible for protecting the systems have little influence on those stressors. To save the reefs, seagrass meadows, etc, of the Caribbean we need to look beyond these individual impacts and design a more comprehensive look at our ocean systems and supported by scientific evidence (that I’m sure is already published).","We need to continue research into genetics of coral ecosystems to do our best in finding climate change resistant strains. Many scientists are currently working on this research, and this decade will be important to take the research from concept to active reef restoration around the world. Helping to promote this research will be crucial.",PLASTIC - plastic plastic everywhere. We need to address this and come up with scientific methods to remove plastics from our ocean systems.
